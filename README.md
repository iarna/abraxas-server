Abraxas Gearmand
----------------

A fully functional Gearmand server

    gearmand-abraxas

This starts a gearman server on port 4730 on all interfaces on localhost.
This is currently not configurable. The server runs in the foreground.

Obviously, more is planned for this, see the [TODO](TODO.md) document for
details on the command line client itself, or the [Abraxas
library](https://github.com/iarna/abraxas) for new Gearman protocol
features.
